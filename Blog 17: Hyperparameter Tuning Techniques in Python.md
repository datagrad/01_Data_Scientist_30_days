# Blog 17: Hyperparameter Tuning Techniques in Python

## Introduction

Once you've chosen a machine learning model and preprocessed your data, one of the next steps is to adjust the model's hyperparameters for optimal performance. This blog aims to introduce you to various hyperparameter tuning techniques and how to implement them in Python.

## What are Hyperparameters?

Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before training a model. Unlike model parameters, which the model learns from the data, hyperparameters are configured to facilitate the learning process.

## Types of Hyperparameter Tuning Techniques

### Grid Search

Grid Search is the most straightforward method, where you specify a subset of the hyperparameter space to explore.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Sample data
X = [[1, 2], [5, 8], [1.5, 1.8]]
y = [0, 1, 0]

# Define hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']}

# Grid Search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(SVC(), param_grid)
grid_search.fit(X, y)
```

### Random Search

Random Search randomly samples from a distribution over the hyperparameter space.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV

# Define hyperparameter grid
param_dist = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']}

# Random Search
random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(SVC(), param_dist)
random_search.fit(X, y)
```

### Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian Optimization builds a probabilistic model of the function mapping from hyperparameters to a performance metric.

```python
from skopt import BayesSearchCV

# Define hyperparameter grid
param_dist = {'C': (0.1, 10.0, 'uniform'), 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']}

# Bayesian Optimization
bayes_search = BayesSearchCV(SVC(), param_dist)
bayes_search.fit(X, y)
```

## Evaluating Hyperparameter Tuning

After performing hyperparameter tuning, you can access the best parameters and the best model as follows:

```python
# Best parameters from Grid Search
best_params_grid = grid_search.best_params_

# Best model from Random Search
best_model_random = random_search.best_estimator_
```

## Conclusion

Hyperparameter tuning is a critical step in optimizing the performance of machine learning models. Although it can be computationally expensive, it's often necessary to achieve the best model performance. In the next blog, we'll discuss ensemble methods, techniques that combine multiple models to improve overall performance.
