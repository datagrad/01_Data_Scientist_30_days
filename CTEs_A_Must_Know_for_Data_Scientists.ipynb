After our deep dives into SQL essentials, advanced techniques, subqueries, and window functions, it's time to explore a topic that's often overlooked but incredibly useful: Common Table Expressions, or CTEs. Think of a CTE as a googly in cricket—an unexpected, strategic move that can throw even seasoned data professionals off balance. In this blog, we'll introduce you to CTEs and show you how they can simplify your SQL queries.\n",
