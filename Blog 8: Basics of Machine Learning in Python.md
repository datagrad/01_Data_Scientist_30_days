# Blog 8: Basics of Machine Learning in Python

## Introduction

With a strong foundation in data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis, you are now ready to step into the world of machine learning. This blog aims to introduce you to the basics of machine learning in Python, a pivotal stage in your data science journey.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Essentially, it's all about making predictions or decisions based on data.

## Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning can be broadly classified into three types:

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, we train the model on a labeled dataset, which means each training example is paired with an output label. The model makes predictions or decisions based on input data and is corrected when its predictions are incorrect.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning involves training the model on a dataset without labels. The system tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the data without any supervision.

### Reinforcement Learning
In reinforcement learning, the agent makes decisions by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal or solve a problem. The agent is rewarded or penalized with a point system based on the actions it takes.

## Popular Python Libraries for Machine Learning

- **Scikit-learn**: For general-purpose machine learning.
- **TensorFlow**: For neural networks and deep learning.
- **XGBoost**: For optimized gradient-boosting.

## A Simple Machine Learning Example Using Scikit-Learn

Let's see a simple example using Scikit-learn where we use a logistic regression model for classification.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Initialize logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

## Conclusion

Machine learning is a vast field with a plethora of algorithms and techniques. The most crucial part is understanding which algorithm to use for different types of problems. This blog serves as an introduction to the fascinating world of machine learning in Python. In the next blog, we will dive deeper into supervised learning algorithms, which are among the most commonly used machine learning techniques.
