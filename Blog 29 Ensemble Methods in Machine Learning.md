# Blog 29: Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning

## Introduction

While individual machine learning models can be powerful, they often have limitations. Ensemble methods aim to overcome these limitations by combining multiple models to create a more robust and accurate 'meta-model.' This blog will introduce you to various ensemble techniques and their applications.

## What are Ensemble Methods?

Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple base estimators to improve generalizability, robustness, and performance. The main idea is that a group of 'weak learners' can come together to form a 'strong learner.'

## Types of Ensemble Methods

### Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

Bagging involves training the same algorithm multiple times on different subsets of the training data.

#### Random Forest

Random Forest is a popular bagging algorithm that constructs multiple decision trees during training.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Random Forest
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Boosting

Boosting algorithms train a series of models sequentially, each correcting the errors of its predecessor.

#### AdaBoost

AdaBoost adjusts the weights of observations based on the errors of the previous model.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier

# AdaBoost
model = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=50)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting minimizes the loss function of the previous models by adding new models.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

# Gradient Boosting
model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Stacking

Stacking involves using the predictions of multiple models as inputs to a final 'meta-model.'

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import StackingClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Stacking
estimators = [('rf', RandomForestClassifier()), ('svm', SVC())]
model = StackingClassifier(estimators=estimators, final_estimator=LogisticRegression())
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Pros and Cons of Ensemble Methods
