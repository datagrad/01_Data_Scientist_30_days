# Blog 20: Anomaly Detection Techniques in Machine Learning

## Introduction

Anomaly detection is one of the fascinating applications of machine learning. It's used in a wide range of areas including fraud detection, system health monitoring, and fault detection. This blog aims to introduce you to various anomaly detection techniques and their implementation in Python.

## What is Anomaly Detection?

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying abnormal patterns that do not conform to expected behavior. These anomalies can often be indicative of some kind of problem like fraud, errors, or a rare condition in a system.

## Types of Anomalies

- **Point Anomalies**: Single instances that are anomalous with respect to the rest of the data.
- **Contextual Anomalies**: Anomalies that are context-specific, often temporal in nature.
- **Collective Anomalies**: A collection of instances that are anomalous.

## Anomaly Detection Techniques

### Statistical Methods

Statistical methods often involve creating a model of "normal" behavior and then flagging anything that deviates from this model.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Sample data
data = np.array([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 100])

# Z-score
z_scores = np.abs(stats.zscore(data))
outliers = np.where(z_scores > 2)
```

### Machine Learning Methods

Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM are popular machine learning methods for anomaly detection.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Fit model
model = IsolationForest()
model.fit(data.reshape(-1, 1))

# Predict anomalies
pred = model.predict(data.reshape(-1, 1))
```

### Time-Series Analysis

For temporal data, techniques like ARIMA can be adapted for anomaly detection.

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Sample data
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 100, 6, 7]

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(data, order=(1, 1, 1))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Residuals
residuals = model_fit.resid
```

### Deep Learning Methods

Autoencoders can be used for anomaly detection, especially for high-dimensional data.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense

# Define autoencoder
input_layer = Input(shape=(X.shape[1],))
encoded = Dense(50, activation='relu')(input_layer)
decoded = Dense(X.shape[1], activation='sigmoid')(encoded)
autoencoder = Model(input_layer, decoded)

# Fit model
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
autoencoder.fit(X, X)
```

## Conclusion

Anomaly detection is a critical application of machine learning that's widely used in various domains. By identifying outliers or anomalies, businesses and organizations can act preemptively to mitigate risks and issues. In the next blog, we will explore clustering techniques, another set of unsupervised learning methods.
