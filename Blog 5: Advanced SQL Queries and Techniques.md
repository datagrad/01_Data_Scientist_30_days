# Blog 5: Advanced SQL Queries and Techniques

## Introduction

Having covered the basics of SQL in the last blog, you're now ready to explore more advanced querying techniques. These skills are essential for complex data analysis and manipulation tasks. In this blog, we'll go over subqueries, aggregation functions, and window functions, among other advanced SQL features.

## Subqueries

Subqueries, also known as inner queries or nested queries, are SQL queries embedded within another SQL query.

### Basic Subquery

A basic subquery can be used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query as a condition.

```sql
SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM Employees);
```

In this example, the subquery calculates the average age of all employees, and the main query returns the names of employees older than the average age.

## Aggregation Functions

Aggregation functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. 

### Common Aggregation Functions

- **COUNT()**: Counts the number of rows.
  
- **SUM()**: Adds up the values in a numeric column.
  
- **AVG()**: Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
  
- **MIN()** and **MAX()**: Get the minimum and maximum values.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(ID), AVG(Age), MIN(Age), MAX(Age) FROM Employees;
```

## Window Functions

Window functions operate on a set of rows and return a single aggregated value for each row.

### Basic Window Functions

- **RANK()**: Provides a unique rank for each distinct row within a result set partition.
  
```sql
SELECT Name, Age, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Age) AS rnk FROM Employees;
```

## Combining Python and Advanced SQL

You can use Python libraries like SQLite to execute these advanced SQL queries.

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to database
conn = sqlite3.connect('employees.db')

# Use an aggregation function
cursor = conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(ID), AVG(Age) FROM Employees;")
for row in cursor:
    print("Total Employees:", row[0], "Average Age:", row[1])

# Use a window function
cursor = conn.execute("""
SELECT Name, Age, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Age) AS rnk 
FROM Employees;
""")
for row in cursor:
    print(row)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

## Conclusion

Advanced SQL querying techniques such as subqueries, aggregation functions, and window functions are essential for complex data manipulation and analysis tasks. These methods allow you to execute intricate queries that can serve as powerful tools for data analysis, especially when combined with Python. In the next blog, we will explore how to clean and preprocess data in Python, a crucial step in any data science project.
